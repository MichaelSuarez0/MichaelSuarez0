## Hi 👋 Welcome to my repository!  

### I'm Michael Suárez, a Political Science graduate, but a Data Scientist at heart.  
I studied at the **Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú**. I completed a **Diploma in Data Science for Public Management** at the **Artificial Intelligence and Computational Methods in Social Sciences Laboratory (QLAB)** at the same university. Additionally, I have pursued a variety of online courses in programming to further enhance my expertise.

I'm passionate about contributing to the **automation of government processes** and bringing **technological innovation** to areas that need it. My goal is to **free individuals from tedious, repetitive tasks** so they can focus on activities that foster **critical thinking, continuous learning, and creativity**—the very things that make us human.
